# Instructions

- Use existing documents:
  使用现有的操作程序、支持脚本或政策文档来创建 LLM 友好的 routines.
- Prompt agents to break down tasks:
  提供更小、更清晰的步骤有助于最大限度地减少歧义, 并帮助模型更好地遵循指令.
- Define clear actions:
  确保 routine 中的每一步都对应一个特定的行动或输出.
- Capture edge cases:
  实际交互通常会产生决策点, 一个健壮的 routine 会预测常见的变化,
  并包含关于如何通过条件步骤或分支来处理它们的指令, e.g. 在缺少所需信息时提供替代步骤.

```md
您是 LLM 智能体指令编写专家.
请将以下帮助中心文档转换为一组清晰的指令, 以编号列表形式编写.
该文档将成为 LLM 遵循的政策. 确保没有歧义, 并且指令是以智能体的指示形式编写的.
要转换的帮助中心文档如下 {{help_center_doc}}

How to write a great `AGENTS.md` [lessons from over 2500 repositories](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-write-a-great-agents-md-lessons-from-over-2500-repositories):

1. States a clear **role**:
   Defines who the agent is (expert technical writer),
   what skills it has (Markdown, TypeScript),
   and what it does (read code, write docs).
2. Executable **commands**: Gives AI tools it can run (npm run docs:build and npx markdownlint docs/). Commands come first.
3. **Project** knowledge: Specifies tech stack with versions (React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS) and exact file locations.
4. Real **examples**: Shows what good output looks like with actual code. No abstract descriptions.
5. Three-tier **boundaries**: Set clear rules using always do, ask first, never do. Prevents destructive mistakes.

## Vibe Coding

1. Spec the work:
   - 目标: picking next highest-leverage goal
   - 分解: breaking the work into small and verifiable slice (pull request)
   - 标准: writing acceptance criteria, e.g. inputs, outputs, edge cases, UX constraints
   - 风险: calling out risks up front, e.g. performance hot-spots, security boundaries, migration concerns
2. Give agents context:
   - 仓库: Repository conventions
   - 组件: Component system, design tokens and patterns
   - 约束: Defining constraints: what not to touch, what must stay backward compatible
3. Direct agents `what`, not `how`:
   - 工具: Assigning right tools
   - 文件: Pointing relevant files and components
   - 约束: Stating explicit guardrails, e.g. `don't change API shape`, `keep this behavior`, `no new deps`
4. Verification and code review:
   - 正确性 (correctness): edge cases, race conditions, error handling
   - 性能 (performance): `N+1` queries, unnecessary re-renders, over-fetching
   - 安全性 (security): auth boundaries, injection, secrets, SSRF
   - 测试 (tests): coverage for changed behaviors
5. Integrate and ship:
   - Break big work into tasks agents can complete reliably
   - Merge conflicts
   - Verify CI
   - Stage roll-outs
   - Monitor regressions

## System

OpenAI [Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex)
system [prompts](../recipes/prompts/codex.md):

- Instructions.
- Git instructions.
- `AGENTS.md` spec.
- Citations instructions.

## Coding

[Writing](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md)
good [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md):

- `AGENTS.md` should define your project's **WHY**, **WHAT**, and **HOW**.
- **Less is more**.
  Include as few instructions as reasonably possible in the file.
- Keep the contents of your `AGENTS.md` **concise and universally applicable**.
- Use **Progressive Disclosure**.
  Don't tell Agent all the information to know, tell Agent when to needs, how to find and use it.
- Agent is not a linter.
  Use linters and code formatters,
  and use other features like [Hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) and [Slash Commands](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands).
- `AGENTS.md` is the highest leverage point of the harness, so avoid auto-generating it.
  You should carefully craft its contents for best results.

## Pull Request

GitHub [copilot](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-use-github-copilot-spaces-to-debug-issues-faster)
to debug issues faster:

```md
You are an experienced engineer working on this codebase.
Always ground your answers in the linked docs and sources in this space.
Before writing code, produce a 3–5 step plan that includes:

- The goal
- The approach
- The execution steps

Cite the exact files that justify your recommendations.
After I approve a plan, use the Copilot coding agent to propose a PR.
```

## Testing

```md
Create a test agent for this repository. It should:

- Have the persona of a QA software engineer.
- Write tests for this codebase
- Run tests and analyzes results
- Write to “/tests/” directory only
- Never modify source code or remove failing tests
- Include specific examples of good test structure
```
