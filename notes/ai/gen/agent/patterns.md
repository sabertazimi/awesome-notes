# Patterns

Agent design [patterns](https://rlancemartin.github.io/2026/01/09/agent_design):

- Give agents a computer (CLI and files)
- Progressive disclosure
- Offload context
- Cache context
- Isolate context
- Evolve context

## Agent-Native

[Agent-native](https://every.to/guides/agent-native) apps should:

- Parity (对等性): 用户通过 UI 完成任务 `<->` Agent 通过工具实现.
- Granularity (细粒度): tools should be atomic primitives.
- Composability: 有了上述两点, 只需编写新的提示词即可创建新功能.
- Emergent capability.
- Files as universal interface: files for legibility, databases for structure.
- Improvement over time:
  - Accumulated context: state persists across sessions.
  - Developer-level refinement: system prompts.
  - User-level customization: user prompts.

:::tip[Agent-native Product]

Build capable foundation,
observe what users ask agent to do,
**formalize patterns** that emerge:

- Common patterns: domain tools.
- Frequent requests: dedicated prompts.
- Unused tools: remove.

## Self-Evolving

Self-evolving [agents](https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Self-Evolving-Agents),
use runtime experience and external signals to optimize future behavior:

- Enhanced context engineering.
- Tool optimization and creation.
